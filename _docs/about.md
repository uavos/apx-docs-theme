The [APX Automatic Control System](hw) provides hardware and vehicle controls abstraction layer for your *Unmanned Vehicle*, making it able to operate fully autonomous.

The system has distributed architecture, all [nodes](hw) are connected together through Controller Area Network (CAN) interface. There may be several boards of the same type connected to the same system, making multiple levels of [redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)).

The Software and firmware can now be evaluated on [Open Hardware platform](hw/nodes/xhawk.md) for free.
