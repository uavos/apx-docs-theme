The [Ground Control](gcs) software is supplied with SDK to create plugins or communicate with the UAV from user programs. The UI is fully customizable and uses modern [Qt framework](http://qt.io) with exported QML and JavaScript engine. APX framework still keeps the ability to develop your own algorithms to control vehicle operations or specific payload, running your code [onboard](fw/conf/vm.md).
