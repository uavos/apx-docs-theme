Thanks to its [distributed architecture](hw), the APX system can be used in vehicles from as small as quadcopter to big converted manned aircrafts. The redundancy layers are provided as basic functionality. [Ground Control](gcs) software is multi-platform and is capable to manage multiple workstations in a wide or local area network. Any specific sensor or payload can be integrated by scripting custom protocols through [onboard VMs](fw/conf/vm.md).
